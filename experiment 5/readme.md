Topic: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — Breast Cancer Classification

What it does: Loads the Breast Cancer dataset, performs data inspection and preprocessing, encodes diagnosis labels (Benign/Malignant), applies feature scaling (StandardScaler) since KNN is distance-based, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains a KNN classifier, experiments with different values of K to find optimal performance, predicts diagnosis labels, evaluates performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, identifies misclassified cases, analyzes model sensitivity to K, and visualizes results using confusion matrix, accuracy vs K plot, and decision boundary (using two features).

Topic: Decision Tree Classifier — Loan Approval Prediction

What it does: Loads the Loan Prediction dataset, performs preprocessing including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains a Decision Tree classifier, experiments with different tree depths and pruning to control overfitting, predicts loan approval status (Approved/Rejected), evaluates performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, analyzes feature importance, detects overfitting by comparing training and testing accuracy, compares shallow vs deep trees, and visualizes results using confusion matrix, tree structure plot, and feature importance plot.
