Scenario 1 — scenario_1_exp_4_.ipynb

Notebook: scenario_1_exp_4_.ipynb
Dataset used: uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset — file: spam.csv
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

Topic: Multinomial Naïve Bayes — SMS Spam Classification

What it does: Loads the SMS Spam dataset, performs text preprocessing (lowercase conversion and punctuation removal), converts text into numerical features using Count Vectorization, encodes target labels, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains a Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier with Laplace smoothing, predicts message classes, evaluates performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, analyzes misclassified messages, and visualizes results using confusion matrix, feature importance (top spam words), and spam vs ham word frequency comparison.

Scenario 2 — scenario_2_exp_4_.ipynb

Notebook: scenario_2_exp_4_.ipynb
Dataset used: sklearn Iris dataset — built-in dataset
Dataset link: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#iris-dataset

Topic: Gaussian Naïve Bayes — Iris Flower Classification

What it does: Loads the Iris dataset, performs data inspection and feature scaling, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier, predicts flower species labels, evaluates performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, compares predictions with actual labels, analyzes class probabilities, optionally compares with Logistic Regression, and visualizes results using confusion matrix and decision boundary plot.
